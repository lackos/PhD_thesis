Very large basis sets are used, with l up to 8, and 36 electron are correlated. The accuracy of the resulting transition energies is tested by applying the same method to Pb; calculated ionization potentials and excitation energies agree with experiment within a few hundredths of an eV, and similar accuracy is expected for the heavier element. Ionization potentials and excitation energies of E114 are considerably higher than for Pb, due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s and 7p(1/2) orbitals. This indicates that eka-lead will probably be more inert and less metallic than lead. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

However, in such measurements it is difficult to combine a high efficiency with a high spectral resolution. Here we demonstrate the on-line application of atomic laser ionization spectroscopy in a supersonic gas jet, a technique suited for high-precision studies of the ground- and isomeric-state properties of nuclei located at the extremes of stability. The technique is characterized in a measurement on actinium isotopes around the N=126 neutron shell closure. A significant improvement in the spectral resolution by more than one order of magnitude is achieved in these experiments without loss in efficiency.},

Having more than one clock transition in Yb could benefit the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model via studying the non-linearity of King's plot or the time-variation of the ratio of the frequencies of two clock transitions. We calculate the lifetime of the states, relevant transition amplitudes, systematic shifts, and the sensitivity of the clock transitions to a variation of the fine structure constant. We find that both clock transitions can probably support very high precision, similar to what is already achieved for the $^1$S$_0$ - $^3$P$^{\rm o}_0$ clock transition.},

Four chains were attributed to the new nuclide 270Hs, which decays by alpha-particle emission with Qalpha=9.02+/-0.03 MeV to 266Sg which undergoes spontaneous fission with a half-life of 444(-148)(+444) ms.

abstract = {Theories unifying gravity and other interactions suggest the possibility of spatial and temporal variation of physical ``constants'' in the Universe. Detection of high-redshift absorption systems intersecting the sight lines towards distant quasars provides a powerful tool for measuring these variations. We have previously demonstrated that high sensitivity to the variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ can be obtained by comparing spectra of heavy and light atoms (or molecules). Here we describe new calculations for a range of atoms and ions, most of which are commonly detected in quasar spectra: Fe ii, Mg ii, Mg i, C ii, C iv, N v, O i, Al iii, Si ii, Si iv, Ca i, Ca ii, Cr ii, Mn ii, Zn ii, Ge ii (see the results in Table III). The combination of Fe ii and Mg ii, for which accurate laboratory frequencies exist, has already been used to constrain $\alpha$ variations. To use other atoms and ions, accurate laboratory values of frequencies of the strong E1 transitions from the ground states are required. We wish to draw the attention of atomic experimentalists to this important problem. We also discuss a mechanism which can lead to a greatly enhanced sensitivity for placing constraints on variation on fundamental constants. Calculations have been performed for Hg ii, Yb ii, Ca i, and Sr ii where there are optical transitions with the very small natural widths, and for hyperfine transition in Cs i and Hg ii.},

However, the location of the center and the extension of the island of stability remain vague.

abstract = {The electronic spectrum of atomic nobelium (element 102) is calculated in preparation for a planned experiment. The intermediate-Hamiltonian (IH) coupled-cluster method is applied to the ionization potential and excitation energies of the atom, using a large basis set (37s 31p 26d 21f 16g 11h 6i) and correlating the outer 42 electrons. All the levels studied are obtained simultaneously by diagonalizing the IH matrix. The rows and columns of this matrix correspond to all excitations from correlated occupied orbitals to virtual orbitals in a large P space (8s 6p 6d 4f 2g 1h), and the matrix elements are "dressed" by including excitations to the higher virtual orbitals (Q space) at the coupled cluster singles-and-doubles level. Lamb shift corrections are included. The accuracy is assessed by applying the same method to ytterbium, the lighter homologue of No. The calculated ionization potential of Yb is within 3 meV of experiment, and the average error in the lowest 20 excitation energies of the atom is 300 cm-1. Nobelium is the heaviest element for which a reliable semiempirical estimate of the ionization potential exists, 6.65 (7) eV; the calculated value of 6.632 eV is in excellent agreement. Transition amplitudes are obtained from an extensive relativistic configuration interaction calculation. The outstanding feature of the predicted nobelium spectrum is a very strong line at 30 060 cm-1, with an amplitude A=5.0× 108 s-1, corresponding to the 7s7p P11 →7 s2 S01 transition. Putting the error limit conservatively at 0.1 eV, we predict a strong feature in the No spectrum at 30 100±800 cm-1. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Two years after the discovery of element 117, we undertook a second campaign using the Bk249+Ca48 reaction for further investigations of the production and decay properties of the isotopes of element 117 on a larger number of events. The experiments were started in the end of April 2012 and are still under way. This Letter presents the results obtained in 1200 hours of an experimental run with the beam dose of Ca48 of about 1.5?1019 particles. The Bk249 target was irradiated at two energies of Ca48 that correspond to the maximum probability of the reaction channels with evaporation of three and four neutrons from the excited 129717. In this experiment, two decay chains of 129417 (3n) and five decay chains of 129317 (4n) were detected. In the course of the long-term work, Cf249-the product of decay of Bk249 (330d)-is being accumulated in the target. Consequently, in the present experiment, we also detected a single decay of the known isotope 129418 that was produced during 2002-2005 in the reaction Cf249(Ca48,3n)129418. The obtained results are compared with the data from previous experiments.

abstract = {The periodic table provides a classification of the chemical properties of the elements. But for the heaviest elements, the transactinides, this role of the periodic table reaches its limits because increasingly strong relativistic effects on the valence electron shells can induce deviations from known trends in chemical properties. In the case of the first two transactinides, elements 104 and 105, relativistic effects do indeed influence their chemical properties, whereas elements 106 and 107 both behave as expected from their position within the periodic table. Here we report the chemical separation and characterization of only seven detected atoms of element 108 (hassium, Hs), which were generated as isotopes (269)Hs (refs 8, 9) and (270)Hs (ref. 10) in the fusion reaction between (26)Mg and (248)Cm. The hassium atoms are immediately oxidized to a highly volatile oxide, presumably HsO(4), for which we determine an enthalpy of adsorption on our detector surface that is comparable to the adsorption enthalpy determined under identical conditions for the osmium oxide OsO(4). These results provide evidence that the chemical properties of hassium and its lighter homologue osmium are similar, thus confirming that hassium exhibits properties as expected from its position in group 8 of the periodic table.},

These extreme values reflect, in addition to the general trends in the Periodic Table, the relativistic expansion and destabilization of the outer valence 7p(3/2) orbital. Van der Waals coefficients C(3) and adsorption enthalpies DeltaH(ads) of Ne through element 118 on noble metals and inert surfaces, such as quartz, ice, Teflon, and graphite, were calculated in a physisorption model using the atomic properties obtained. The C(3) coefficients were shown to steadily increase in group 18, while the increase in DeltaH(ads) from Ne to Rn does not continue to element 118: The large atomic radius of the latter element is responsible for a decrease in the interaction energy. We therefore predict that experimental distinction between Rn and 118 by adsorption on these types of surfaces will not be feasible.

abstract = {We derive an approximate expression for a "radiative potential" which can be used to calculate QED strong Coulomb field radiative corrections to energies and electric dipole (E1) transition amplitudes in many-electron atoms with an accuracy of a few percent. The expectation value of the radiative potential gives radiative corrections to the energies. Radiative corrections to E1 amplitudes can be expressed in terms of the radiative potential and its energy derivative (the low-energy theorem): the relative magnitude of the radiative potential contribution is $\sim$alpha^3 Z^2 ln(1/(alpha^2 Z^2)), while the sum of other QED contributions is $\sim$alpha^3 (Z_i+1)^2, where Z_i is the ion charge; that is, for neutral atoms (Z_i=0) the radiative potential contribution exceeds other contributions $\sim$Z^2 times. The advantage of the radiative potential method is that it is very simple and can be easily incorporated into many-body theory approaches: relativistic Hartree-Fock, configuration interaction, many-body perturbation theory, etc. As an application we have calculated the radiative corrections to the energy levels and E1 amplitudes as well as their contributions (-0.33% and 0.42%, respectively) to the parity non-conserving (PNC) 6s-7s amplitude in neutral cesium (Z=55). Combining these results with the QED correction to the weak matrix elements (-0.41%) we obtain the total QED correction to the PNC 6s-7s amplitude, (-0.32 +/- 0.03)%. The cesium weak charge Q_W=-72.66(29)_{exp}(36)_{theor} agrees with the Standard Model value Q_W^{SM}=-73.19(13), the difference is 0.53(48).},

abstract = {Precision calculations of the ground and low-lying excited electronic states of the Rf atom (Z = 104) were performed. The relativistic effects were taken into account with the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian. The finite nucleus size was taken into account in the Fermi model (A = 267). The correlation effects were described by the combined scheme that we suggested previously, which proved to be efficient: The relativistic coupled clusters method with one- and two-particle cluster amplitudes in the Fock space was used for describing the correlations of 44 outer electrons of the Rf atoms in a fairly large atomic basis set, and for the four valence electrons occupying the 7s, 7p, and 6d states, the contributions from three- and four-particle cluster amplitudes were taken into account using the complete configuration interaction method, but in a relatively small basis set. The relativistic configuration and term for the ground state of the Rf atom were refined, and the energies of its excitation to low-lying states were calculated. The accuracy of the calculation by the generalized relativistic effective core potential method was evaluated by comparing the results with those obtained similarly using the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian. ?

The present study confirmed that the ground state of atomic Lr is [Rn]5f(14)7s(2)7p (2)P(o)(1/2). The calculation for Lr required wave function expansions of more than 330 000 configuration states. In Lu, the transition energies, with Breit and QED corrections included, agree with experiment to within 126 cm(-1). In lighter elements, core correlation is usually neglected but was found to be of extreme importance for these heavy elements, affecting the oscillator strengths by a factor of 3 and 2 in Lu and Lr, respectively.},

abstract = {The results of two experiments designed to synthesize element 115 isotopes in the 243Am+48Ca reaction are presented. Two new elements with atomic numbers 113 and 115 were observed for the first time. With 248-MeV 48Ca projectiles, we observed three similar decay chains consisting of five consecutive $\alpha$ decays, all detected in a total time interval of 30 s. Each chain was terminated by a spontaneous fission (SF) with a high-energy release and a lifetime of about a day. With 253-MeV 48Ca projectiles, we registered a different decay chain of consecutive $\alpha$ decays detected in a time interval of 0.5 s, also terminated by spontaneous fission, but after 1.8 h. The decay properties of the eleven new $\alpha$- and SF-decaying nuclei are consistent with expectations for consecutive $\alpha$ decays originating from the parent isotopes 288115 and 287115, produced in the 3n- and 4n-evaporation channels, respectively. Support for the assignment of the atomic numbers of all of the nuclei in the 288115 decay chain was obtained in an independent experiment in which a long-lived spontaneous fission activity, 268Db (15 events), was found to be chemically consistent with the fifth group of the periodic table. The odd-odd isotope 288115 was observed with largest cross section of about 4 pb. In the SF decay of 268Db, a total kinetic energy of 230 MeV and a neutron multiplicity per fission of 4.2 were measured. The decay properties of the 11 new isotopes with Z=105–115 and the production cross sections are in agreement with modern concepts of the role of nuclear shells in the stability of superheavy nuclei. The experiments were carried out at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research.},

abstract = {In this brief, and by no means complete, review I discuss situations in string theory, in which Lorentz Invariance Violation may occur in a way consistent with world-sheet conformal invariance, thereby leading to acceptable, in principle, string backgrounds. In particular, I first discuss spontaneous Lorentz violation in (non supersymmetric) open string field theory. Then, I move onto a discussion of gravity-induced modified dispersion relations in non-critical (Liouville) strings, in the sense of an induced Finsler-like geometry depending on both coordinates and momenta, for string propagation in non-trivial space times (such as D-particle ``foamy situations''). I pay attention to explaining the appearance of bi-metric models from such string theories, which could serve as examples of alternative scenaria to dark matter. Finally, I make some comparisons with similar developments in other contexts, such as critical strings in non-commutative space times, as well as deformed special relativities and theories with reduced Lorentz symmetry, advocated recently, where again Finsler geometry seems to come into play. In this latter respect, I put the emphasis on phenomenology and attempt to answer the question as to whether there is the possibility of experimental disentanglement of the various approaches.},

Two experimental methods were applied: nuclear spectroscopy analysis of the antiproton annihilation residues one mass unit lighter than the target mass and the measurements of strong-interaction effects on antiprotonic x rays. Assuming the validity of two-parameter Fermi neutron and proton distributions at these large radii, the conclusions are that the two experiments are consistent with each other and that for neutron rich nuclei it is mostly the neutron diffuseness which increases and not the half-density radius. The obtained neutron and proton rms radii differences are in agreement with previous results.},

abstract = {We present a measurement of the standard model CP violation parameter sin2 phi(1) based on a 29.1 fb(-1) data sample collected at the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e(+)e(-) collider. One neutral B meson is fully reconstructed as a J/psi K(S), psi(2S)K(S), chi(c1)K(S), eta(c)K(S), J/psi K(L), or J/psi K(0) decay and the flavor of the accompanying B meson is identified from its decay products. From the asymmetry in the distribution of the time intervals between the two B meson decay points, we determine sin2 phi(1) = 0.99+/-0.14(stat)+/-0.06(syst). We conclude that we have observed CP violation in the neutral B meson system.},

abstract = {Energy-consistent two-component semi-local pseudopotentials for the superheavy elements with atomic numbers 111-118 have been adjusted to fully relativistic multi-configuration Dirac-Hartree-Fock calculations based on the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian, including perturbative corrections for the frequency-dependent Breit interaction in the Coulomb gauge and lowest-order quantum electrodynamic effects. The pseudopotential core includes 92 electrons corresponding to the configuration [Xe]4f(14)5d(10)5f(14). The parameters for the elements 111-118 were fitted by two-component multi-configuration Hartree-Fock calculations in the intermediate coupling scheme to the total energies of 267 up to 797 J levels arising from 31 up to 62 nonrelativistic configurations, including also anionic and highly ionized states, with mean absolute errors clearly below 0.02 eV for averages corresponding to nonrelativistic configurations. Primitive basis sets for one- and two-component pseudopotential calculations have been optimized for the ground and excited states and exhibit finite basis set errors with respect to the finite-difference Hartree-Fock limit below 0.01 and 0.02 eV, respectively. General contraction schemes have been applied to obtain valence basis sets of polarized valence double- to quadruple-zeta quality. Results of atomic test calculations in the intermediate coupling scheme at the Fock-space coupled-cluster level are in good agreement with those of corresponding fully relativistic all-electron calculations based on the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian. The results demonstrate besides the well-known need of a relativistic treatment at the Dirac-Coulomb level also the necessity to include higher-order corrections for the superheavy elements.},

abstract = {The results of two experiments designed to synthesize element 115 isotopes in the 243Am+48Ca reaction are presented. Two new elements with atomic numbers 113 and 115 were observed for the first time. With 248-MeV 48Ca projectiles, we observed three similar decay chains consisting of five consecutive $\alpha$ decays, all detected in a total time interval of 30 s. Each chain was terminated by a spontaneous fission (SF) with a high-energy release and a lifetime of about a day. With 253-MeV 48Ca projectiles, we registered a different decay chain of consecutive $\alpha$ decays detected in a time interval of 0.5 s, also terminated by spontaneous fission, but after 1.8 h. The decay properties of the eleven new $\alpha$- and SF-decaying nuclei are consistent with expectations for consecutive $\alpha$ decays originating from the parent isotopes 288115 and 287115, produced in the 3n- and 4n-evaporation channels, respectively. Support for the assignment of the atomic numbers of all of the nuclei in the 288115 decay chain was obtained in an independent experiment in which a long-lived spontaneous fission activity, 268Db (15 events), was found to be chemically consistent with the fifth group of the periodic table. The odd-odd isotope 288115 was observed with largest cross section of about 4 pb. In the SF decay of 268Db, a total kinetic energy of 230 MeV and a neutron multiplicity per fission of 4.2 were measured. The decay properties of the 11 new isotopes with Z=105–115 and the production cross sections are in agreement with modern concepts of the role of nuclear shells in the stability of superheavy nuclei. The experiments were carried out at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research.},

However, in such measurements it is difficult to combine a high efficiency with a high spectral resolution. Here we demonstrate the on-line application of atomic laser ionization spectroscopy in a supersonic gas jet, a technique suited for high-precision studies of the ground- and isomeric-state properties of nuclei located at the extremes of stability. The technique is characterized in a measurement on actinium isotopes around the N=126 neutron shell closure. A significant improvement in the spectral resolution by more than one order of magnitude is achieved in these experiments without loss in efficiency.},

abstract = {Superheavy nuclei represent the limit of nuclear mass and charge; they inhabit the remote corner of the nuclear landscape, whose extent is unknown. The discovery of new elements with atomic numbers Z > or = 110 has brought much excitement to the atomic and nuclear physics communities. The existence of such heavy nuclei hangs on a subtle balance between the attractive nuclear force and the disruptive Coulomb repulsion between protons that favours fission. Here we model the interplay between these forces using self-consistent energy density functional theory; our approach accounts for spontaneous breaking of spherical symmetry through the nuclear Jahn-Teller effect. We predict that the long-lived superheavy elements can exist in a variety of shapes, including spherical, axial and triaxial configurations. In some cases, we anticipate the existence of metastable states and shape isomers that can affect decay properties and hence nuclear half-lives.},

This indicates the possible discovery of new neutron-rich transactinide nuclei using relatively light heavy ion beams of the most neutron-rich stable isotopes and actinide targets.},

abstract = {Two years after the discovery of element 117, we undertook a second campaign using the Bk249+Ca48 reaction for further investigations of the production and decay properties of the isotopes of element 117 on a larger number of events. The experiments were started in the end of April 2012 and are still under way. This Letter presents the results obtained in 1200 hours of an experimental run with the beam dose of Ca48 of about 1.5?1019 particles. The Bk249 target was irradiated at two energies of Ca48 that correspond to the maximum probability of the reaction channels with evaporation of three and four neutrons from the excited 129717. In this experiment, two decay chains of 129417 (3n) and five decay chains of 129317 (4n) were detected. In the course of the long-term work, Cf249-the product of decay of Bk249 (330d)-is being accumulated in the target. Consequently, in the present experiment, we also detected a single decay of the known isotope 129418 that was produced during 2002-2005 in the reaction Cf249(Ca48,3n)129418. The obtained results are compared with the data from previous experiments. The experiments are carried out in the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, using the heavy-ion cyclotron U400. ? 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We derive an approximate expression for a "radiative potential" which can be used to calculate QED strong Coulomb field radiative corrections to energies and electric dipole (E1) transition amplitudes in many-electron atoms with an accuracy of a few percent. The expectation value of the radiative potential gives radiative corrections to the energies. Radiative corrections to E1 amplitudes can be expressed in terms of the radiative potential and its energy derivative (the low-energy theorem): the relative magnitude of the radiative potential contribution is $\sim$alpha^3 Z^2 ln(1/(alpha^2 Z^2)), while the sum of other QED contributions is $\sim$alpha^3 (Z_i+1)^2, where Z_i is the ion charge; that is, for neutral atoms (Z_i=0) the radiative potential contribution exceeds other contributions $\sim$Z^2 times. The advantage of the radiative potential method is that it is very simple and can be easily incorporated into many-body theory approaches: relativistic Hartree-Fock, configuration interaction, many-body perturbation theory, etc. As an application we have calculated the radiative corrections to the energy levels and E1 amplitudes as well as their contributions (-0.33% and 0.42%, respectively) to the parity non-conserving (PNC) 6s-7s amplitude in neutral cesium (Z=55). Combining these results with the QED correction to the weak matrix elements (-0.41%) we obtain the total QED correction to the PNC 6s-7s amplitude, (-0.32 +/- 0.03)%. The cesium weak charge Q_W=-72.66(29)_{exp}(36)_{theor} agrees with the Standard Model value Q_W^{SM}=-73.19(13), the difference is 0.53(48).},

abstract = {The periodic table provides a classification of the chemical properties of the elements. But for the heaviest elements, the transactinides, this role of the periodic table reaches its limits because increasingly strong relativistic effects on the valence electron shells can induce deviations from known trends in chemical properties. In the case of the first two transactinides, elements 104 and 105, relativistic effects do indeed influence their chemical properties, whereas elements 106 and 107 both behave as expected from their position within the periodic table. Here we report the chemical separation and characterization of only seven detected atoms of element 108 (hassium, Hs), which were generated as isotopes (269)Hs (refs 8, 9) and (270)Hs (ref. 10) in the fusion reaction between (26)Mg and (248)Cm. The hassium atoms are immediately oxidized to a highly volatile oxide, presumably HsO(4), for which we determine an enthalpy of adsorption on our detector surface that is comparable to the adsorption enthalpy determined under identical conditions for the osmium oxide OsO(4). These results provide evidence that the chemical properties of hassium and its lighter homologue osmium are similar, thus confirming that hassium exhibits properties as expected from its position in group 8 of the periodic table.},

The role of quantum electrodynamic effects beyond the no-virtual-pair approximation, which is usually neglected in relativistic molecular calculations, is discussed. Changes in periodic trends due to relativistic effects are outlined for the superheavy elements with nuclear charge Z=111-120.

The accuracy of the resulting transition energies is tested by applying the same method to Pb; calculated ionization potentials and excitation energies agree with experiment within a few hundredths of an eV, and similar accuracy is expected for the heavier element. Ionization potentials and excitation energies of E114 are considerably higher than for Pb, due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s and 7p(1/2) orbitals. This indicates that eka-lead will probably be more inert and less metallic than lead. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

Very good agreement with experiment is obtained for the Tl transition energies. As in the case of elements 111 [Eliav et al., Phys. Rev.

Thus the d(10)s-->d(9)s(2) energy of E113(2+) is 0.1 eV, compared to 8 eV for Tl2+. It is predicted that divalent or trivalent compounds of E113 with an open 6d(9) shell could possibly exist.

We compute the shell correction at spherical shape using self-consistent nuclear models: the non-relativistic Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach and the relativistic mean-field model, for a number of parametrizations. All the forces applied predict a broad valley of shell stabilization around Z = 120 and N = 172-184. We also predict two broad regions of shell stabilization in hyperheavy elements with N ≈ 258 and N ≈ 308. Due to the large single-particle level density, shell corrections in the superheavy elements differ markedly from those in lighter nuclei. With increasing proton and neutron numbers, the regions of nuclei stabilized by shell effects become poorly localized in particle number, and the familiar pattern of shells separated by magic gaps is basically gone. {\textcopyright} 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {High-accuracy calculations of atomic properties of the superheavy elements (SHE) up to element 122 are reviewed. The properties discussed include ionization potentials, electron affinities and excitation energies, which are associated with the spectroscopic and chemical behavior of these elements, and are therefore of considerable interest. Accurate predictions of these quantities require high-order inclusion of relativity and electron correlation, as well as large, converged basis sets. The Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian, which includes all terms up to second order in the fine-structure constant $\alpha$, serves as the framework for the treatment; higher-order Lamb shift terms are considered in some selected cases. Electron correlation is treated by either the multiconfiguration self-consistent-field approach or by Fock-space coupled cluster theory. The latter is enhanced by the intermediate Hamiltonian scheme, allowing the use of larger model (P) spaces. The quality of the calculations is assessed by applying the same methods to lighter homologs of the SHEs and comparing with available experimental information. Very good agreement is obtained, within a few hundredths of an eV, and similar accuracy is expected for the SHEs. Many of the properties predicted for the SHEs differ significantly from what may be expected by straightforward extrapolation of lighter homologs, demonstrating that the structure and chemistry of SHEs are strongly affected by relativity. The major scientific challenge of the calculations is to find the electronic structure and basic atomic properties of the SHE and assign its proper place in the periodic table. Significant recent developments include joint experimental-computational studies of the excitation spectrum of Fm and the ionization energy of Lr, with excellent agreement of experiment and theory, auguring well for the future of research in the field.},

The isotropic and anisotropic components of the polarizability increase monotonically with the nuclear charge Z, except for the spin-orbit coupled J=0 states, which start to decrease from Sn to Pb and even further to element Z=114. Hence, spin-orbit coupling leads to a significant reduction of the polarizability of element Z=114, i.e., from 47.9 a.u. at the scalar-relativistic Douglas-Kroll level to 31.5 a.u. at the Dirac-Coulomb level of theory, which is below the value of Si (37.3 a.u.). The calculations further demonstrate that relativistic and electron correlation effects are nonadditive. The measured dipole polarizabilities of Sn and Pb are in reasonable agreement with the theoretical values. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

The main goal is to predict excitation energies, in anticipation of planned spectroscopy of Lr. The ground state of Lr is 7s 2 7p 2 P 1/2 , unlike the 5d6s 2 2 D 3/2 of Lu. Predicted Lr excitations with large transition moments in the prime range for the planned experiment, 20 000–30 000 cm −1 , are 7p → 8s at 20 100 cm −1 and 7p → 7d at 28 100 cm −1 . The average absolute error of 20 excitation energies of Lu is 423 cm −1 , and the error limits for Lr are put at 700 cm −1 . The two electron affinities measured recently for Lu are reproduced within 55 cm −1 , and a third bound state of Lu − is predicted.

abstract = {Chemical investigations of superheavy elements in the gas-phase, i.e. elements with Z≥104, allow assessing the influence of relativistic effects on their chemical properties. Furthermore, for some superheavy elements and their compounds quite unique gas-phase chemical properties were predicted. The experimental verification of these properties yields supporting evidence for a firm assignment of the atomic number. Prominent examples are the high volatility observed for HsO4or the very weak interaction of Cn with gold surfaces. The unique properties of HsO4were exploited to discover the doubly-magic even-even nucleus270Hs and the new isotope271Hs. The combination of kinematic pre-separation and gas-phase chemistry allowed gaining access to a new class of relatively fragile compounds, the carbonyl complexes of elements Sg through Mt. A not yet resolved issue concerns the interaction of Fl with gold surfaces. While competing experiments agree on the fact that Fl is a volatile element, there are discrepancies concerning its adsorption on gold surfaces with respect to its daughter Cn. The elucidation of these and other questions amounts to the fascination that gas-phase chemical investigations exert on current research at the extreme limits of chemistry today.},

abstract = {Theories unifying gravity and other interactions suggest the possibility of spatial and temporal variation of physical ``constants'' in the Universe. Detection of high-redshift absorption systems intersecting the sight lines towards distant quasars provides a powerful tool for measuring these variations. We have previously demonstrated that high sensitivity to the variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ can be obtained by comparing spectra of heavy and light atoms (or molecules). Here we describe new calculations for a range of atoms and ions, most of which are commonly detected in quasar spectra: Fe ii, Mg ii, Mg i, C ii, C iv, N v, O i, Al iii, Si ii, Si iv, Ca i, Ca ii, Cr ii, Mn ii, Zn ii, Ge ii (see the results in Table III). The combination of Fe ii and Mg ii, for which accurate laboratory frequencies exist, has already been used to constrain $\alpha$ variations. To use other atoms and ions, accurate laboratory values of frequencies of the strong E1 transitions from the ground states are required. We wish to draw the attention of atomic experimentalists to this important problem. We also discuss a mechanism which can lead to a greatly enhanced sensitivity for placing constraints on variation on fundamental constants. Calculations have been performed for Hg ii, Yb ii, Ca i, and Sr ii where there are optical transitions with the very small natural widths, and for hyperfine transition in Cs i and Hg ii.},

abstract = {A review of the discovery and investigation of the ‘island of stability' of super-heavy nuclei at the separator DGFRS (FLNR, JINR) in the fusion reactions of 48 Ca projectiles with target nuclei 238 U- 249 Cf is presented. The synthesis of the heaviest nuclei, their decay properties, and methods of identification are discussed. The role of shell effects in the stability of super-heavy nuclei is demonstrated by comparison of the experimental data and results of theoretical calculations. The radioactive properties of the new nuclei, the isotopes of elements 112–118 as well as of their decay products, give evidence of the significant increase of the stability of the heavy nuclei with rise of their neutron number and approaching magic number N = 184.},
